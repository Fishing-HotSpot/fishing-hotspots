# Fishing HotSpots

Fishing HotSpots project was created to showcase three of Tennessee's hottest fishing spots and also, to provide data on different species of fish in those said spots. Users are then able to vote on which lake is the hottest spot amongst the three which are: Old Hickory, Percy Priest, and Radnor Lakes.

    This project was great. I had the opportunity to work with my teammates and we were able to accomplish our goals and more. I think having a team and working through difficult tasks is amazing because everyone had to the opportunity to explore how we all think firm a technical standpoint.
